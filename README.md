## About
Solar 7 was developed to work with Google Maps Platform Solar API providing:
 - insights about the location, dimensions, and solar potential of a building.
 - URLs for raw solar information datasets for an area surrounding a location.
 - Digital surface model, an aerial image, annual and monthly flux maps, and hourly shade.

Solar 7 will help users:

- Remotely design a solar power system.
- Reduce solar site assessment time.
- Prioritize installation locations.
- Create more accurate proposals.
- Increase customer conversion rates.
- Provide insightful details to educate consumers.


The Google Maps Platform Solar API is a service focused on helping accelerate solar and energy system installations. The Solar API makes detailed rooftop data based on Google's expansive mapping and computing resources available to help estimate renewable rooftop solar energy potential and savings.

> **WARNING**: Before you can start using the Google Maps Platform APIs and SDKs, you must sign up and create a [billing account](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#create-billing-account)!
